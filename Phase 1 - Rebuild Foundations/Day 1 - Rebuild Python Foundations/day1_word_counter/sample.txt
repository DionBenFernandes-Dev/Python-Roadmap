Abhishek Thakur (Kaggle Grandmaster & Data Scientist): Abhishek is a 3× Kaggle Grandmaster who largely taught himself machine learning. He found formal coursework too theoretical, so he “started learning on my own” by jumping into Kaggle competitions, studying winners’ solutions, and reading/implementing research papers over months. He emphasizes a baseline-then-iterate approach: always begin with simple models (e.g. TF-IDF for text) to establish a personal benchmark, then only introduce complex models (like neural nets) once simpler approaches are saturated. Abhishek keeps pace with new developments via Twitter/ArXiv, and he stresses building a portfolio of polished projects (e.g. real Kaggle entries) rather than unfinished experiments. “It’s very important to have a good portfolio of projects… in the end, it’s all about perseverance,” he advises.
